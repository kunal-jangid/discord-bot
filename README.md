# A discord bot named Kun
A while back, I tried out `discord.py` and made a bot. It wasn't the best there was, but the experience taught me a lot. I learnt about bot events, intents, embedding and a lot more awesome things. I named it `Kun bot` and currently it is serving in my personal server on Discord. 

I hosted it on Repl.it, which in itself is a pretty good web hosting site. 

Here, take a look at this screenshot of the bot's hosted status on Repl.it
